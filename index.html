            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Am called Esibe Vanessa Enih. The 3rd in a family of five. My dad is a retired militry officer and my Mom is a farmer. After gratuating from the University in 2018, I realized that tech had more openings and laverage. In 2020 at the peak of corona I started my Journey in Tech. This Journey has been very tought and hard for me as a self learner. so I feel so honor to be selected for the Zuri Training.

        <div class="coding">
            <p> As a programmer, you are going to work on exciting projects! One of the best parts of being a programmer is creating something that didn't exist before.
                To talk to me personaly, contact me on linkedin</p>
            <p>When you're coding, you are always learning and challenging yourself due to the non-repeating nature of the tasks!</p> 
            <p>  While creating a program or app, you constantly expand your understanding of the problem and the solution, trying out new frameworks, solving tricky issues with new algorithms, and using a different methodology. All this results in stretching your mind and improving your patience, perseverance, and discipline.</p>
            <p>When you manage to build an app that can save humans' time and prevent them from doing tricky tasks, you make a small difference in people's lives
                Undoubtedly.</p>
            <p> In brief, coding may obviously push you outside of your comfort zone, but in a good way!</p>
